#Population Change Function to model population development in one year,
given parameters:

N0 - Number of adults in the patch 
b - Growth rate 
l_max - maximum population that may survive in the habitat 
patch - on which patch we are working

OR: we only take Patch as input, we have pre-defined the parameters for
each patch, and do a short look up, and use the last row of the patch X
column to than compute the new population

```{r Population Change}

```

#Dispersal Function to model dispersal in one patch in one year given
parameters:

Patch - which patch are we looking at disp_prob - probability to change
the patch

```{r Dispersal}

```

#Gamete Production Function to model gamete production for all
individuals in one patch.

```{r}

```
